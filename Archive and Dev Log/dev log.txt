V0.3
This version is mainly for the listener agent, I want it to merge the income transcripts into sentences before pass it to check.
Prompts: v0_3_1.txt, v0_3_2.txt, v0_3_3.txt, v0_3_4.txt


V0.2
This version basically didn't do anything. Trying separate on a secondary agent might help

Asking the assistant to 
1 merge the income transcripts
2 only check participants response with the list
Prompts: v0_2.txt

V0.1
Created a test assistant and tried the idea. Seems working. 
Prompts: v0_1.txt
